# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

Today-I-Learned (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learn today.

This repo has a tool that help you to manage and write down what you learned in scientific way.

# Instruction

- Step 1: Fork this repo (blank-repo with **only tool** and **readme file**).
- Step 2: Start writting down what you learned in **everyday**.
  + Create a **topic** by:

    ```bash
    ./til <CATEGORY> <SUBJECT> [EDITOR]
    ```

    - Ex:

    ```bash
    ./til bash "Bash Conditional Expression" vim
    ```

    - If you tired of typing the quote mark:

    ```bash
    ./til bash Bash-Conditional-Expression
    ./til bash Bash=Conditional=Expression
    ```

    DO NOT mix the `-` and `=` together!
  + It will create 1 file whose name which is the SUBJECT in lower case:  `bash/160510-bash-conditional-expression.md`.
  + **Write** it! **Save** it!
- Step 3: Commit what you learned today by `./til commit`. After that, if you want to push it to _repository_, just **Enter**
